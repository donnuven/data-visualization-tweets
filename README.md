# Tweeting Mill - A Twitter Data Visualization CLI Tool

## Purpose summary:

This project was made in terms of learning purposes on how to utilize data from a real-time feed found on a popular social platform and transforming
that data set into a visual form of data.

## Dependencies:
This project requires a Twitter API key to gain access to the Twitter API in order to gain access to the data of the platform itself in order to 
run this data visualization tool.

## Additional File:
For this project to run, make sure you store your keys from the Twitter API in the config file, after you register on Twitter site as a developer 
to gain access to the Twitter API keys and tokens. Once those keys are in place, you should be able to use the standard way of running a python project
by entering the following command into the current directory of the project in the terminal: ``python tweets.py``
